1. Direct emissions (N2O):
This refers to direct emissions of nitrous oxide (N₂O), a potent greenhouse gas, directly released into the atmosphere from specific activities like agriculture, industrial processes, and combustion of fossil fuels.
2. Indirect emissions (N2O):
Indirect emissions of nitrous oxide refer to emissions that result indirectly from human activities. For example, emissions resulting from the volatilization and deposition of nitrogen from fertilizers can eventually transform into nitrous oxide.
3. Emissions (N2O):
This typically represents the total emissions of nitrous oxide (N₂O), combining both direct and indirect sources.
4. Emissions (CO2eq) from N2O (AR5):
CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) is a metric used to compare the emissions of various greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential (GWP) relative to CO2 over a specific time period (typically 100 years).
This refers to the total emissions of nitrous oxide (N₂O) expressed in CO2 equivalents based on the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The GWP of N₂O is significantly higher than that of CO2, so even small emissions of N₂O have a large impact on the climate.
5. Emissions (CO2eq) (AR5):
This represents the total greenhouse gas emissions expressed as CO2 equivalents, based on the AR5 report. It includes various gases like CO2, methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), and uses their GWPs to express their impact relative to CO2.
6. Emissions (CH4):
This refers to the emissions of methane (CH₄), another potent greenhouse gas. Methane is released during the production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as by livestock and other agricultural practices.
7. Emissions (CO2eq) from CH4 (AR5):
This is the methane emissions (CH₄) expressed as CO2 equivalents using the GWP from the AR5 report. Methane has a much higher GWP than CO2, so CH₄ emissions are scaled up in CO2 equivalents to reflect their greater impact on global warming.
8. Emissions (CO2):
This refers to the direct emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the most common greenhouse gas emitted through human activities, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.
9. Emissions (CO2eq) from F-gases (AR5):
F-gases refer to fluorinated gases like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆). These gases have a very high GWP.
This term refers to the emissions of these fluorinated gases expressed in CO2 equivalents, again based on the AR5 report. Even though their emissions might be small in quantity, their high GWP makes them significant contributors to global warming.
